# BACKLOG — everything left to build

**This is the canonical list of outstanding work for wondish_02.** Start here.
Last consolidated: 2026-08-17.

It supersedes, and pulls the live items out of:

| Source | Status |
|---|---|
| `tasks/todo.md` | still the detailed record — history + root-cause notes. Live items are mirrored here. |
| `docs/productionStage.md` | **STALE, unaudited** — see §7. Do not trust it without re-verifying. |
| `cycle.md` | per-release checklist, not features — see §6. |
| `docs/restaurants/roadmap.md` | the restaurant phase plan — see §3. |
| `docs/superpowers/plans/*.md` | executed plans. Unticked checkboxes there do **not** mean incomplete; this repo does not tick them during execution. |

Confidence is marked per item: **[verified]** checked against code this session ·
**[reported]** taken from an existing doc, not re-checked.

## 1. In flight — built but not landed

- [ ] **Merge + push `feat/restaurants-phase-3-attribution`** (11 commits) and the
      2 doc commits on `main`. Suite 1001/1001, tsc 19 pre-existing, build green.
      **[verified]**
      ⚠️ Pushing puts the sign-up redirect into production: every new account now
      routes through `/r/claim`. Do one live sign-up test first — that path cannot
      be exercised locally.
      ⚠️ The migration is already applied to the shared Neon DB, so those tables
      exist in prod ahead of the code.

## 2. Safety gates — clear before promoting `/restaurants` publicly

The consumer restaurant pages are **already live in production**. These two decide
whether the verdicts on them can be trusted.

- [ ] **`Verdict.caution` is hard-coded `false`** (`lib/restaurants.ts`), so the
      rule "any absent/unverified ingredient ⇒ caution, never fits" is not
      enforced — a dish passes on the ingredient list as given. Phase-1 verdict
      logic; the UI already renders a third state. **[verified]**
- [ ] **Stockton pilot ingredients are AI-inferred**, pending ops confirmation
      (D-INGREDIENTS). The design resolved that no AI may sit in the verdict path;
      published lists must be human-confirmed. Ops work, not engineering.
      **[reported]**

## 3. Restaurant roadmap — the unbuilt phases

Shipped: Phase 1 (model + eval API), Phase 2 web (directory + menu), Phase 3
attribution slice (§1/§2/§5), Phase 6a (the whole owner portal).

- [ ] **Phase 3 §3 — the discount rail.** `SignupDiscount` + `DiscountDelivery`.
      Blocked on the business questions in §5 below. Lands as one more column plus
      a model; attribution already exists. **[verified]**
- [ ] **Phase 4 — ranking + "Going Out Tonight".** `lib/restaurant-ranking.ts` and
      a dashboard card. Unblocked by other work. **PAUSED 2026-08-20 during design.**
      Findings from that session, worth keeping: only **5 published restaurants**
      exist, so the ranking orders a very small set; the doc's cuisine-variety term
      has almost no data behind it (**2** `MealLog` rows carry a `restaurantDishId`,
      because nothing writes them yet — web has no "Add to today" and the iOS tab is
      unbuilt); and the `/restaurants` directory already shows "N of M dishes fit
      you" per restaurant, so the card's marginal value is smaller than the doc
      implies. Open decisions when resuming: which ranking signals for v1 (diet-fit
      alone vs also macro-fit); where the surface lives (dashboard grid card per the
      doc, vs leading the directory); and what a user with no diet profile sees.
      **[verified: all four counts]**
- [ ] **Phase 5 — cuisine rotation + ratings.** Activates `ratingBoost`.
      **[reported]**
- [ ] **Phase 6 — monetisation half.** Paid placement (`sponsorBoost`, capped and
      labelled) + recommended-dish discount + reconciliation. Blocked on §5.
      **[reported]**
- [ ] **Phase 7 — geo + Clara restaurant skill.** `latitude`/`longitude` exist but
      are nullable and unused; needs a geocoding provider. Clara-in-app needs
      Clara iOS Phase 5. **[verified: columns unused]**
- [ ] **Phase 2 iOS — Restaurants tab.** In the Clara repo
      (`~/Desktop/BeTech/Clara`), gated on Clara iOS Phase 2. The plan calls iOS
      the primary surface. **[reported]**

### Smaller restaurant gaps

- [ ] **`scans` has a rate limit, not a dedup** — link previews, crawlers and
      double-taps from distinct IPs still pad the conversion denominator.
      **[verified]**
- [ ] **`/r/claim` sets no `maxDuration`** around its Clerk call, on the sign-up
      hot path. **[verified]**
- [ ] **"Add to today" from a restaurant dish on web** — optional;
      `MealLogSource.RESTAURANT` already exists. **[verified]**

## 4. Product + engineering backlog

- [ ] **Clara repo drift — uncommitted, and one item is a real config change.**
      `~/Desktop/BeTech/Clara` has 7 unpushed commits plus 2 uncommitted files
      (noticed 2026-08-26). **[verified]**
      1. `Config/Debug.xcconfig` points the **Debug** build at production:
         `WONDISH_BASE_URL` localhost:3000 → `https://www.wondish.io`, and
         `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` placeholder → the real `real-mollusk-38` test
         instance. Not made in this session — it was already in the tree. Anyone
         building Debug from this checkout now hits prod, not localhost. Decide
         whether that is intended before committing it.
      2. `Clara.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` gained `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = KG8MY6KKAW`
         from the 2026-08-15 signing setup (~200 other changed lines are Xcode
         re-sorting, not content). The project is generated by XcodeGen from
         `project.yml`, so regenerating wipes it and signing breaks again —
         moving it into `project.yml` makes it stick, at the cost of committing
         the team ID.
      Neither repo is broken; this is drift that will confuse the next build.


- [ ] **Journal shows "No history yet" despite logged meals.** `/api/journal/calendar`
      reads only `JournalMeal`; Meal Plan "Add to log", Restaurants "Add to today"
      and Fridge "Log it" all write `MealLog`, which the journal never reads. Fix:
      merge `MealLog` rows into the `allMeals=1` mode. Own mini-cycle. **[reported]**
- [ ] **Scan tab: real implementation** (currently a "coming soon" stub inside
      Cook). **[reported]**
- [ ] **Promote Clerk from the dev instance** (`real-mollusk-38`, `pk_test`) to a
      `pk_live` production instance — dev-instance session churn caused the
      "login every time" episode. **[reported]**
- [ ] **App Store prep** — `Assets.xcassets` / `AppIcon`. **[reported]**
- [ ] **Confirm `scripts/backfill-meal-plan-weight.ts`** still needs its one-time
      prod run. **[reported]**
- [ ] **Live prod smoke** — one interactive sign-in, then sweep Meal Plan /
      Supplements / Journal grid / Account stats / chat streaming against
      www.wondish.io. **[reported]**

### Accepted, on the record (not scheduled)

- [ ] Journal "today" frozen at VM init — midnight staleness. **[reported]**
- [ ] Session-expiry-while-foregrounded never flips the root gate. **[reported]**
- [ ] USD-only price copy convention. **[reported]**
- [ ] 3 cosmetic `TODO`s in marketing components (two unset "Learn more"
      destinations, one unconnected food-availability form). **[verified]**

---

## 5. Blocked on business decisions — not on code

- [ ] **Q1. Sign-up discount** — %, and what it applies to (the restaurant bill or
      the Wondish subscription). Different rails.
- [ ] **Q2. Who funds it, and how it is redeemed** at the table.
- [ ] **Q3. Paid placement pricing** and how the boost combines with organic rank.
- [ ] **Q4. Is Wondish ever in the money flow?** Determines whether reconciliation
      is in scope at all.
- [ ] **Paywall D1–D4** — StoreKit-only? $14.99? 7-day trial? quotas — plus App
      Store Connect setup (D9) and Apple root CA certs.
- [ ] **D13** — account hard-delete cascading Subscription rows; legal/product
      sign-off pending.

---

## 6. Per-release checklist (recurring, from `cycle.md`)

Not features — run these each release:
`prisma migrate deploy` verified against prod · required env vars present in
Vercel · Clerk `azp` allowlist includes `io.wondish.clara` · unauthenticated
probes of new routes return JSON 401 · one interactive simulator sign-in.

---

## 7. Needs an audit before it can be trusted

- [ ] **Audit `docs/productionStage.md` (16 open items) against current code.**
      Confirmed stale in part: it claims "no unit tests for any of the engine",
      but `lib/caloric-engine.test.ts` has **92 tests**. Confirmed still true: two
      different lb→kg constants (`0.45359237` at `caloric-engine.ts:82` vs
      `0.453592` at `:356`). Several of its items map to entries already marked
      `[x]` in `tasks/todo.md`. Until audited, treat that file as unreliable rather
      than as 16 live production risks. **[verified: both spot-checks]**
